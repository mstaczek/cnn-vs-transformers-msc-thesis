# Folder where the datasets are stored

A folder has a structure that can be used with [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.html) from the torch library.

An example dataset is [Imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) which is a subset of [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) with 10 classes and around 1300 images per class (13394 images in total).
